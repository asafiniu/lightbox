Create a web page that shows a grid of photo thumbnails;

When a thumbnail is clicked, the photo should be displayed in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the photo title.

You can use any public API that returns photos; here are some ideas:
- Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photosets.getPhotos.html
- Google Image Search: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview
